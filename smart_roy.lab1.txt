Question 1: Which word most often follows the word “happy”?
	The word "birthday" most often follows "happy".


Question 2: Which word most often follows the word "sad"?
	The word "song" most often follows the word "sad".


Question 3: How many different (unique) words follow the word "computer"?
	58 different words follow the word "computer".


Question 4: Which word most often follows the word "computer"?
	The word "love" most often follows the word "computer".


Question 5: How many times does this word follow "computer"?
	The word "love" follows "computer" 13 times.


Question 6: Using the starting word "happy", what song title do you get?
	happy birthday song for the world is a little girl in the world is a little girl in the world is


Question 7: Using the starting word “sad”, what song title do you get?
	sad song for the world is a little girl in the world is a little girl in the world is a


Question 8: Using the starting word “hey”, what song title do you get?
	hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey


Question 9: Using the starting word “little”, what song title do you get?
	little girl in the world is a little girl in the world is a little girl in the world is a


Question 10: Try a few other words. What problem(s) do you see? Which phrase do you most often find recurring in 
these titles?
	The output of the program for a few other words is:

		Enter a word [Enter 'q' to quit]: best
		best of the world is a little girl in the world is a little girl in the world is a little, 20 words
		Enter a word [Enter 'q' to quit]: great
		great big city of the world is a little girl in the world is a little girl in the world is, 20 words
		Enter a word [Enter 'q' to quit]: while
		while you are you are you are you are you are you are you are you are you are you are, 20 words
		Enter a word [Enter 'q' to quit]: oh
		oh my heart of the world is a little girl in the world is a little girl in the world is, 20 words
		Enter a word [Enter 'q' to quit]: final
		final countdown to the world is a little girl in the world is a little girl in the world is a, 20 words

	The main problem with the average song title is that it gets into infinite loops. A word will link through one 
	or more other words back to itself, creating a song title that would never end if it weren't for the twenty
	word limit. The most common loop starts with the word "the", producing the endless title: "the world is a 
	little girl in the world...".


Question 10 (the second): Using the starting word “amore”, what song title do you get?
	amore mio babbino caro nome na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na


Question 11: Using the starting word “love”, what song title do you get?
	love you are you are you are you are you are you are you are you are you are you are


Question 12: Using the starting word “little”, what song title do you get?
	little girl like you are you are you are you are you are you are you are you are you are


Question 13: (Bad luck I assume?)


Question 14: Explain why so many of the titles devolve into repeating patterns.
	Many of the titles devolve into repeating patterns because the same word often precedes and follows the next
	word in the bigram. If a word links to itself through one or more bigrams, it will form a repeating pattern.
	(From the text of Lab 1, it implies that we should describe a fix for this problem. The best fix would involve 
	implementing some sort of memory that would know if a word already has an occurance in the average song title.
	If the word already exists, we would select the next most common word from the bigram double hash table.)


Question 15: Try several words. Find a song title that terminates in less than 20 words. Could you find one? If so,
which song title did you find? If not, why not?
	A song title that ends in less than 20 words is one that starts with "brush". It produces only a two word song
	title: "brush arbors".
